    <h1 align=center>Connor Kolb</h1>
    <p align=center>Connor is tired today and wants to eat some food. He also <br>
        wants you to see this cool clicker game he created. <br>
        Wanna try it? Check it out below! :) Nevermind, he forgot <br>
        that Andrew did not let him merge into dev yesterday and <br>
        when he checked out Jacob's new changes, he lost all of <br>
        his work :(. It is a sad day in Connor's life</p>
